    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p>Vos Savant's response was that <mark>the contestant should switch to the other door.</mark> Under the standard assumptions, <mark>contestants who switch have a 2 / 3 chance of winning the car</mark>, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a 1 / 3 chance.</p>
